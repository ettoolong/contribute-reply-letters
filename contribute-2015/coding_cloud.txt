Hi, thanks for taking an interest in Mozilla's Cloud Services. Glad to hear from you!

Cloud Services has a whole lot of projects! Many of them can be found at https://github.com/mozilla-services and cover a wide variety of languages and technologies. The best way to get involved is to hop onto one of our project IRC channels and start asking questions (new to irc? Check out http://irc.mozilla.org). High profile channels include:

Firefox Accounts: #fxa
Heka: #heka
Sync: #sync
MLS: #geo
Push Services: #push
General coding: #introductions

If you don't have a project in mind, or aren't sure where to go, no problem! Just hop onto #services-dev and folks there can give you pointers. Remember that our engineers are scattered across the globe, so they may not always be on when you expect them to - give them a bit of time to respond.

Feel free to drop me a line if you're having problems or other questions - I'm telliott on IRC, or at telliott@mozilla.com

Look forward to hearing from you,
Toby
