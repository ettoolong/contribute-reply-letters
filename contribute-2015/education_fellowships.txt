Hi,

Thanks for your interest in Knight-Mozilla OpenNews. I'm Erika Owens, program manager with OpenNews. Our project is focused on supporting and strengthening the community around open code in newsrooms.

If you are interested in technology and journalism, this is the spot for you!

We have a Fellowship program [http://opennews.org/fellowships] that places people who love to code with news organizations for 10 months. The applications are open June through August each year.

All year, you can also keep up with the Fellowship and our other activities via our bi-weekly community calls: https://wiki.mozilla.org/OpenNews/Calls. The calls are a place where people in and around the journalism-code community introduce projects and events, ask questions, and share experiences.

Through the calls, you can hear about many ways to further engage with this community--from our website Source [http://source.opennews.org] to newsroom jobs to hack days in communities around the world [http://opennews.org/hackdays.html]. We look forward to collaborating with you on these or other projects.

Thanks,
Erika
