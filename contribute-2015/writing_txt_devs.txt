Hi!

I'm Janet Swisher, Community Manager for the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Network</a> (MDN). MDN's mission is simple: to provide complete, accurate, and helpful documentation for developers who use or create web technologies, whether it's supported by Mozilla-built software or not. If it's an open technology exposed to the Web, we want to document it.

Our focus is documentation for developers by developers. Whether you prefer to work with code, or with words, or with both, whether you're a seasoned veteran programmer or a fresh beginner &mdash; there are ways you can help! We need help with writing, editing, and translating articles, creating example code, and much more.

Please see the MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Getting_started">Getting Started</a> page for instructions on how to create an account, pick a task, and start helping.

Please let me know if you have questions!

Regards,
Janet Swisher
Community Manager
