** GENERIC TEMPLATE **

** DO NOT SIMPLY TRANSLATE THIS TEXT **

To enable the new Get Involved page for your locale, we need to
set-up autoresponders.

If you don't want or plan to localize all autoresponders available in
/templates/mozorg/contribute-2015/, you can create a generic autoresponse
using this file.

Describe your community, what are the channels to get in touch, which
areas your team work on, etc. Try to be friendly and exhaustive ;-)

If you want to use this template for all areas, simply delete the other
.txt files in /templates/mozorg/contribute-2015/ and leave only this file
in the folder.

If instead you plan to localize all other autoresponders, you can delete
this file.

If you have any doubt, send an email to flod(at)mozilla.com and I'll be
glad to help.
