Hi, my name is {INSERT NAME}, and I work on Policy & Advocacy here at Mozilla.Our team works on projects to advance and protect the free and open Web.

We rely on the active support of the global community. There are lots of things you can do to get involved:

1. Join the Mozilla Policy & Advocacy mailing list. This is an email discussion where you can help shape the direction of our policy and advocacy -- locally, regionally and globally.

2. Say hello on a Policy & Advocacy Community call. Join our monthly calls. All are welcome! Ask questions, meet our policy and advocacy community and staff, and find the resources you need.

3. Connect through social media.
Join the conversation on Twitter @MozillaAdvocacy and stay up to date on the Net Policy blog.

4. Donate to Mozilla
As a non-profit organization, we depend on the generosity of people like you to fund our work advocating and fighting for a free and open Web.

Please write us back if you have any questions, and we will be in touch.
