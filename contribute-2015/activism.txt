Hi, my name is Dave, and I work on Advocacy here at Mozilla.Our team works on projects to advance and protect the free and open Web.

We rely on the active support of the global community. There are lots of things you can do to get involved:

1. Join the Mozilla Policy & Advocacy mozillian groups. You will then be invited to an email discussion where you can help shape the direction of our policy and advocacy -- locally, regionally and globally.

2. Check out PriMo (Privacy @ Mozilla) opportunities listed at: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Privacy/PriMo

3. Connect through social media.
Join the conversation on Twitter @MozillaAdvocacy and stay up to date on the Net Policy blog.

4. Donate to Mozilla
As a non-profit organization, we depend on the generosity of people like you to fund our work advocating and fighting for a free and open Web.

Please write us back if you have any questions, and we will be in touch.
