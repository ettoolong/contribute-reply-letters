Thanks so much for your interest in Hive Learning Networks! We’re a global constellation of communities championing digital skills and web literacy through connected learning. We have Hive communities popping up around the world and would love more help spreading #hivebuzz. You can learn more about how to start a Hive in your city here: http://hivelearningnetworks.org/start-a-hive/ or feel free to contact me if you’re interested in volunteering at a local Hive event or have other questions.
Best,
Simona Ramkisson
