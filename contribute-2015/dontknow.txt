Hi, weâ€™re the Mozilla Community Building Team! Thank you for signing up and supporting our mission.

We think Mozilla is really important, and want to help you find your place as a contributor and volunteer in this project.

You can start by going to this forum (link to discourse instance) and introducing yourself! Someone will be happy to point you in the right direction.


Another easy way to get involved is to spread the word about Firefox. Grab a button and put it on your site, Facebook, or blog! https://affiliates.mozilla.org/


Mozilla is a global community of do-gooders, rabble-rousers and passionate defenders of the Web. We are so excited for you to join us.
