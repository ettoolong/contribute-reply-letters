Hi,
I'm Mike, and I work on Web Compatibility. Glad to hear from you!

Web Compatibility means making sure websites are equally usable on all different browsers and mobile devices - so it makes a big difference to internet users like you and I. Thank you for offering to spend your time on this important cause.

To get started diagnosing Web Compatibility issues, please visit:

If you need any help, you can obtain it on IRC. I recommend visiting #webcompat, which is specifically for web compatibility issues. See http://irc.mozilla.org for how to access it.

You may also wish to join the Web Compatibility Email list at: https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/compatibility

Feel free to contact me anytime if you're having any problems! I'm mtaylor@mozilla.com.

Thanks for helping keep the web open and interoperable,

Mike
