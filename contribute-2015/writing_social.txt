Hi!

I'm Aurelien and I want to talk to you about the CommSquared (Community Communications) program, and why it's a great opportunity for you.

We offer you to write, to talk, to spread our mission to the media and to the general public on behalf of Mozilla, and we offer you Public Relations training created by professionals.

So, here's what you can do right now:

- you can learn more about CommSquared by visiting our dedicated wiki page: https://wiki.mozilla.org/CommSquared

- you can subscribe to the CommSquared mailing list to receive the news, and send me back the signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (you’ll find it on the Wiki at the URL above) and become an Insider: https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/commsquared

- you can open a Mozillian account, as you'll need it to join in the program: https://mozillians.org

- you can join our CommSquared Public Yammer group by using your Mozillian LDAP account, and start interacting with fellow CommSquared members across the globe:
https://www.yammer.com/mozillians/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=4252353

- you can also start by writing about your expectations, your skills, your needs: share it on Yammer, send it back to me or just keep it to yourself. What matters is that you know where you stand about the program, how you want to spread the word about Mozilla, and how CommSquared empowers you.

Welcome to CommSquared!

Aurélien
