Thanks for your interest in helping Mozilla teach the web!

Mozilla Webmaker promotes web literacy through hands-on making and sharing. We’re an open source project powered by makers, mentors and community leaders. We’d love you to get involved.

Our teaching guides, tools and community events allow webmakers to not only create the content that makes the web great, but — perhaps more importantly — understand how the web works.

Teaching & Learning
Learning through making is a core part of Mozilla's mission. We provide starter projects, templates and event guides to inspire teachers and learners at every level to create on the web and share their knowledge with others. We consider web literacy a critical skill just like reading, writing and math.

Tools
Creating the web is the heart of our work. We build tools like Thimble, X-Ray Goggles, Popcorn Maker and Appmaker that allow people to create amazing content while peeking under the hood of the internet, getting familiar with all the moving parts and getting their hands dirty with foundational elements like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Community
We recognize that innovation can come from anyone, anywhere, so we bring together people with diverse skills and backgrounds — teachers, filmmakers, journalists, hackers, youth, artists, scientists policy-makers and more — to collaborate online and at events around the globe.

We are so glad you are interested in helping us teach the web. Get started today by creating a Mozilla Webmaker account. Feel free to email or tweet to @webmaker if you have any questions. We’re looking forward to seeing what you create.

All the best,
The Webmaker Team
