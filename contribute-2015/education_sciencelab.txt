Thank you for your interest in the Mozilla Science Lab. We're working to build a global network of researchers, tool developers, librarians and publishers to further science on the web. We believe a community of peers working, learning and building together is needed to make research thrive on the open web.

We do this by:

    * Building communities and technical prototypes;

    * Teaching skills needed to further open practices;

    * Empowering others to learn, solve problems and build new tools together.

Want to get involved? Join us on irc.mozilla in the #sciencelab room, or [join our next community call https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab/Calls]. For more ways you can help, please visit: [our "Get Involved" page http://mozillascience.org/get-involved/] or follow us on Twitter ([http://twitter.com/MozillaScience @MozillaScience]).

We look forward to working with you!
